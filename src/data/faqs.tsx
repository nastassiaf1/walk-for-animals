                While there’s no admission fee, the Walk for Animals is Animal
                Humane Society’s largest and most important fundraising event of
                the year, helping to make thousands of new beginnings possible
                for animals in need each year. The suggested donation for
                non-fundraisers is $20 per person.

                    We want to help make fundraising easy with helpful tools and
                    support. That’s why you’ll find several ready-to-use, easily
                    customizable email templates in your Participant Center.

                <p>
                    You’ll want to start by adding contacts to your address
                    book. When logged in, select #2 in the list of “What to do
                    next.” Here you can add contacts individually, or import a
                    group of contacts. If you’re a returning walker, you’ll see
                    contacts and prior donors saved here already.{' '}

                    Now you’re ready to email your friends, family, and
                    coworkers! From the contacts page, you can select the email
                    addresses you’d like to contact in bulk. To return to the
                    email page in the future, select #3 in the list of “What to
                    do next” when you login, or navigate to the “Email” tab.

                    Choose from several email templates, including three

                    your own from scratch. Then select an email header to
                    accompany your email. From here you can save your customized
                    template for future use, or simply select the “Preview &amp;
                    Send” button to review your email and then send it on to
